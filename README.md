DuPont Analysis of Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd

#Overview:

This project presents a comprehensive DuPont Analysis of Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd, one of India's leading food service companies, best known as the master franchisee for Domino's Pizza and other brands in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. The analysis utilises historical financial data to break down and interpret the drivers of Return on Equity (ROE) for the years 2020-2024.

#What is DuPont Analysis?
DuPont analysis is a powerful tool for dissecting a company's ROE into its core components, helping stakeholders understand the factors behind profitability and financial performance. The formula is:

Return On Equity (ROE) = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
Where:

Net Profit Margin (ROS): A measure of operational efficiency. It shows how much profit a company makes for every rupee of revenue.
Net Profit Margin = Revenue/Net Income
​

Asset Turnover: A measure of asset efficiency. It shows how effectively a company is using its assets to generate revenue.
Asset Turnover = Revenue/Average Total Assets
​
 
Equity Multiplier (Financial Leverage): A measure of financial leverage. It shows the extent to which a company is financed by debt versus equity.
Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets/ Average Shareholders' Equity


#Methodology and Data Sources
The financial data for this analysis, in particular, was sourced from the official annual reports of Jubilant Foodworks for the fiscal years FY2020 to FY2024. The following data points were extracted from the company's Income Statement and Balance Sheet:

* Net Income

* Revenue

* Total Assets (Beginning & End of Year)

* Shareholders' Equity (Beginning & End of Year)

All calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and provide a clear, easy-to-follow model.

#Why DuPont Analysis?
Strictly because DuPont Analysis explains the reason behind the increase in ROE, which in turn makes it so that an investor can actually find out the reason for the increase in ROE and how it could affect the company in the long run.

#Key Findings & Conclusions
Based on the analysis, the primary driver of Jubilant Foodworks' ROE was identified to be a decline in Asset efficiency. The company is struggling with the efficient utilization of its assets.
It also shows that the Equity multiplier has been increasing since COVID, which makes the company highly leveraged, which could pose a risk if continued.

A full breakdown of the calculated ratios and their impact on the company can be found in the Excel sheet.
