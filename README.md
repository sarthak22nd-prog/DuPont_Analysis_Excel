What is DuPont Analysis?
DuPont analysis is a powerful tool for dissecting a company's ROE into its core components, helping stakeholders understand the factors behind profitability and financial performance. The formula is:

ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
where:

Net Profit Margin: A measure of operational efficiency. It shows how much profit a company makes for every rupee of revenue.
Net Profit Margin = Revenue/Net Income
​
 

Asset Turnover: A measure of asset efficiency. It shows how effectively a company is using its assets to generate revenue.

​
 

Financial Leverage (Equity Multiplier): A measure of financial leverage. It shows how much of a company's assets are financed by equity.


Net Profit Margin: Measures operational efficiency.

Asset Turnover Ratio: Gauges asset use efficiency.

Equity Multiplier: Indicates leverage, i.e., the extent to which a company is financed by debt versus equity.
